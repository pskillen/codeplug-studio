# OpenGD77 — wire elicitation worksheet

Fill this in while driving **official OpenGD77 CPS** (Baofeng 1701 / RT-84 profile preferred). For each row: change the setting in CPS UI → **File → CSV → Export to CSV** → record the exact cell text (capitalisation, spaces, punctuation).

**Tracking:** [#403](https://github.com/pskillen/codeplug-studio/issues/403) · Parent [#502](https://github.com/pskillen/codeplug-studio/issues/502) (was [#36](https://github.com/pskillen/codeplug-studio/issues/36))  
**Gap notes:** [`tmp/opengd77-wire-docs-issues.md`](../../../tmp/opengd77-wire-docs-issues.md) (local working notes; gitignored)  
**Headers / adapter:** [`columns.ts`](../../../src/core/import-export/formats/opengd77/columns.ts)  
**Sample CPS export (unedited):** [`sample-codeplugs/opengd77R2025.03.23.1/baofeng-1701/`](../../../sample-codeplugs/opengd77R2025.03.23.1/baofeng-1701/) — OpenGD77 CPS R2025.03.23.1 · Baofeng 1701. Prefer this over `test-data/` for observed wire strings.

> Last 24h of main was mostly NeonPlug / DM32UV / UI — **no OpenGD77 CPS CSV wire ships**. Follow-ups below unchanged except epic renumber.

### Follow-up tickets (filed from #403)

| Area | Issue | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tier-3 docs drift (power table, channels.md, G4EML caveats, …) | [#436](https://github.com/pskillen/codeplug-studio/issues/436) | Open — includes correcting `channels.md` TOT/VOX claims vs adapter hardcodes |
| Redacted / synthetic 1701 fixture under `test-data/` (tests) | [#437](https://github.com/pskillen/codeplug-studio/issues/437) | Open — wire ground truth sample already in `sample-codeplugs/opengd77R2025.03.23.1/baofeng-1701/` |
| CPS-safe defaults for unmodelled channel columns | [#438](https://github.com/pskillen/codeplug-studio/issues/438) | Open |
| Squelch wire map (`Disabled` / `Open` / `Closed` / `Master` / `%`) | [#439](https://github.com/pskillen/codeplug-studio/issues/439) | Open |
| Power ladder + user-power (`+W-` / `-W+`) | [#440](https://github.com/pskillen/codeplug-studio/issues/440) | Open |
| Validate MD-9600 power ladder | [#441](https://github.com/pskillen/codeplug-studio/issues/441) | **Done** — PR [#521](https://github.com/pskillen/codeplug-studio/pull/521); User Power `+W-` still unmodelled |
| OpenGD77 `APRS.csv` body + `Channels.APRS` FK | [#442](https://github.com/pskillen/codeplug-studio/issues/442) (epic [#501](https://github.com/pskillen/codeplug-studio/issues/501)) | Open |

Related (not filed from #403): behavioural cascade on `Rx Only` / `All Skip` [#424](https://github.com/pskillen/codeplug-studio/issues/424) **done** (docs PR [#434](https://github.com/pskillen/codeplug-studio/pull/434)); `txPermit` has no OpenGD77 column (export loss).

Fill this worksheet first for high-priority enums; then land results into tier-3 docs and the tickets above.

### How to use

1. Start from a small scratch codeplug (or a copy of a known-good export).
2. Prefer **one change per export** when unsure; batch only when values are obviously independent.
3. Record **exact wire strings** in **Observed wire values** (e.g. `` `+W-` `` not “plus W”).
4. If CPS UI label ≠ CSV text, put both (UI → wire).
5. Leave **Observed** blank until you personally confirm — pre-filled “hints” are not canon.
6. When done, promote confirmed rows into sibling tier-3 docs (`channels.md`, `power-squelch.md`, …) and file adapter tickets under #36.

### Column key

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Wire field** | Exact CSV header (or member-slot pattern) |
| **Library / build field** | Current Studio model path, or `—(unmodelled)` |
| **Hint (unconfirmed)** | G4EML / User Guide / sample export — **verify** |
| **CPS UI control** | Where you click in CPS (fill in) |
| **Observed wire values** | Exact CSV cell(s) you saw |
| **Range / step / format** | Numeric bounds, step, decimal places, regex-ish pattern |
| **Notes** | Blank vs `None`, mode-dependent, locale, etc. |

**Omit policy:** Only omit a field if you are certain it needs no elicitation. This sheet errs on inclusion.

### 1a. Power ladder (1701) — fill every step

Map **CPS UI label** → **exact `Power` CSV cell** → **approx watts** (optional). Studio stores percent via profile ladder.

| CPS UI / watts (hint) | Observed `Power` wire | Approx W | Studio `%` today (1701) | Notes |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Master / radio default | | | `null` → export `Master` | |
| 50 mW | | 0.05 | `P1` → 1 | |
| 250 mW | | 0.25 | `P2` → 5 | |
| 500 mW | | 0.5 | `P3` → 10 | |
| 750 mW | | 0.75 | `P4` → 15 | |
| 1 W | | 1 | `P5` → 20 | |
| 2 W | | 2 | `P6` → 40 | |
| 3 W | | 3 | `P7` → 60 | |
| 4 W | | 4 | `P8` → 80 | |
| 5 W | | 5 | `P9` → 100 | |
| User power (`+W-` / `-W+`?) | | | —(unmodelled) | Exact string critical |

### 1b. Squelch ladder / specials

| CPS UI | Observed `Squelch` wire | Maps to library? | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Master (band default) | | `squelch: null`? | Confirm if Master appears in CSV |
| Disabled | | | Sample uses this often |
| Open | | | G4EML; User Guide |
| Closed | | | G4EML; User Guide |
| 0% | | | Same as Open/Disabled? |
| 5% | | | Step size |
| 10% | | | |
| 45% (band default hint) | | | |
| 50% | | | |
| 75% | | | Seen in sample |
| 100% | | | Same as Closed? |
| _(other)_ | | | |

### 1c. Tone / DCS patterns

| Kind | CPS UI | Observed wire (RX) | Observed wire (TX) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| None | | | | |
| CTCSS example | | | | e.g. `103.5` |
| DCS Normal | | | | G4EML `DnnnN` |
| DCS Invert | | | | G4EML `DnnnI` |
| Blank on digital | | | | Expect empty |

### 1d. Mode-dependent blank / sentinel matrix

For one analogue + one digital channel, tick what CPS writes when a field is “unused”:

| Wire field | Analogue unused → | Digital unused → |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Bandwidth (kHz)` | | |
| `Colour Code` | | |
| `Timeslot` | | |
| `Contact` | | |
| `TG List` | | |
| `DMR ID` | | |
| `TS1_TA_Tx` / `TS2_TA_Tx ID` | | |
| `RX Tone` / `TX Tone` | | |
| `Squelch` | | |

## 2. `Contacts.csv` (4 columns)

| Wire field | Library / build field | Hint (unconfirmed) | CPS UI control | Observed wire values | Range / step / format | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Contact Name` | `TalkGroup.name` / `DigitalContact.name` (build wire name) | display; FK target | | | | Also used from Channels / TG lists |
| `ID` | `TalkGroup.digitalId` / `DigitalContact.digitalId` | DMR ID integer as text | | | | |
| `ID Type` | entity kind (TG → Group, private → Private) | `Group` \| `Private` \| **`AllCall`?** | | | | Confirm AllCall still exists |
| `TS Override` | —(unmodelled on TG/contact; Studio always `''`) | `Disabled` \| `1` \| `2` | | | | Sample uses these three |

**Naming pattern (optional):** two contacts same ID, names `… TS1` / `… TS2` — note whether TS Override must match name.

| Scenario | Observed `ID Type` | Observed `TS Override` | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Group TG, no override | | | |
| Group TG, force TS1 | | | |
| Group TG, force TS2 | | | |
| Private call | | | |
| AllCall (if available) | | | |

## 3. `TG_Lists.csv` (33 columns)

| Wire field | Library / build field | Hint (unconfirmed) | CPS UI control | Observed wire values | Range / step / format | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `TG List Name` | `RxGroupList.name` (build wire name) | FK from Channels `TG List` | | | | |
| `Contact1`…`Contact32` | `RxGroupList.members[].ref` → contact/TG wire names | max 32; trailing blank OK | | | | Exact name match to Contacts |
| _(cardinality)_ | profile `tgListMembers` (32 on 1701) | Can CPS export >32 cols on other radios? | | | | MD-9600? |

| Question | Observed |
| --- | --- |
| Empty member cells: omitted trailing columns vs padded blanks? | |
| Duplicate member names allowed? | |
| Private + Group mixed in one list? | |

---

## 4. `Zones.csv` (81 columns)

| Wire field | Library / build field | Hint (unconfirmed) | CPS UI control | Observed wire values | Range / step / format | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Zone Name` | `Zone.name` / build zone wire name | unique | | | | |
| `Channel1`…`Channel80` | Zone members → channel wire names (build layout) | max 80; **no space** in header | | | | Zone = scan order |
| _(cardinality)_ | profile `zoneMembers` (80 on 1701) | Other radios differ? | | | | |

| Question | Observed |
| --- | --- |
| Header spelling `Channel1` vs `Channel 1`? | |
| Empty slots: trailing columns omitted? | |
| Duplicate channel in one zone? | |
| Rename channel without updating zone — CPS import behaviour? | |

---

## 5. `DTMF.csv` (2 columns)

| Wire field | Library / build field | Hint (unconfirmed) | CPS UI control | Observed wire values | Range / step / format | Notes |

| --- | --- |
| Max code length? | |
| Case of `A`–`D`? | |
| Empty file (header only) accepted on import? | |

---

## 6. `APRS.csv` (16 columns)

Studio has a **digital** `AprsConfiguration` singleton + `Channel.aprs` binding — **not** a 1:1 map to OpenGD77 named analog APRS configs. Treat this file as wire-only until modelled — export work tracked in [#442](https://github.com/pskillen/codeplug-studio/issues/442) under epic [#246](https://github.com/pskillen/codeplug-studio/issues/246).

Confirm header order:

```text
APRS config Name,SSID,Via1,Via1 SSID,Via2,Via2 SSID,Icon table,Icon,Comment text,Ambiguity,Use position,Latitude,Longitude,TX Frequency,Transmit QSY,Baud rate setting
```

| Wire field | Library / build field | Hint (unconfirmed) | CPS UI control | Observed wire values | Range / step / format | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `APRS config Name` | —(unmodelled); FK from Channels `APRS` | name | | | | |
| `SSID` | — | e.g. `9` | | | | |
| `Via1` | — | e.g. `WIDE1` | | | | |
| `Via1 SSID` | — | e.g. `1` | | | | |
| `Via2` | — | e.g. `WIDE2` | | | | |
| `Via2 SSID` | — | e.g. `1` | | | | |
| `Icon table` | — | sample `0` | | | | Enum/int? |
| `Icon` | — | sample `15` | | | | |
| `Comment text` | — | free text | | | | Max length? |
| `Ambiguity` | — | sample `3` | | | | Allowed set |
| `Use position` | — | sample `False` (bool casing!) | | | | `True`/`False` vs `Yes`/`No` |
| `Latitude` | — | sample `0` | | | | |
| `Longitude` | — | sample `0` | | | | |
| `TX Frequency` | — | MHz 5 dp e.g. `144.80000` | | | | |
| `Transmit QSY` | — | sample `False` | | | | |
| `Baud rate setting` | — | sample `0` | | | | Enum codes? |

### 6a. APRS boolean / enum matrix

| --- | --- | --- |
| `Use position` | | |
| `Transmit QSY` | | |
| `Baud rate setting` | | |
| `Ambiguity` | | |
| `Icon table` / `Icon` | | |

---

## Cross-cutting checks

| Topic | Hint | Observed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Case sensitivity of FKs | `No` ≠ `no`; names exact | |
| Boolean casing Channels | `Yes`/`No` | |
| Boolean casing APRS | `True`/`False`? | |
| `None` sentinel vs empty string | mode-dependent | |
| Import replaces vs Append | G4EML docs | |
| Max channels | 1023 | |
| Channel name max length (LCD) | ~16 | |
| Contact name max length | | |
| Zone name max length | | |
| TG list name max length | | |
