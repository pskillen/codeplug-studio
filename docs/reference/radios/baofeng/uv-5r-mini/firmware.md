# Baofeng UV-5R Mini — firmware

Facts the firmware flasher needs for the UV-5R Mini: the one stock firmware file Studio accepts, and the release patch
format that turns it into a modded build. Product rules: [DESIGN.md — Firmware flashing](../../../../../DESIGN.md#firmware-flashing).

**Code mirror:** [`src/core/radios/baofeng/uv-5r-mini/firmware.ts`](../../../../../src/core/radios/baofeng/uv-5r-mini/firmware.ts)
(`UV5RMINI_STOCK_FIRMWARE`, `UV5RMINI_FIRMWARE_ROLE_UFW`) and
[`src/core/firmware/patch/formats/baofeng-uv5rmini-firmware/`](../../../../../src/core/firmware/patch/formats/baofeng-uv5rmini-firmware/).
Keep them in step.

## Stock firmware pin

The firmware is one `.ufw` file, member role `ufw`. Studio never fetches, hosts or commits it, and no vendor download
is offered: the stock image is the radio's own, which the firmware project builds from a read of that radio. The
image is scrambled per radio, so Studio treats it as opaque bytes and cannot read anything out of it.

| Field     | Value                                                              |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Version   | `v0.04 (NRFB)`                                                     |
| Role      | `ufw`                                                              |
| File name | `stock-nrfb-v0.04.ufw`                                             |
| Size      | 520,192 bytes                                                      |
| sha256    | `02419efb44081227faeccf1525bca0e6b0340c9d988ab80b2141c2ee48a7f74e` |

Studio does not flash stock (`stockFlashOffered: false`); the pin is the base a release patch is checked against.

## Release patch format

A release is a JSON patch (`uv5rmini-fw-<name>.patch.json`) over the stock `.ufw`: ordered in-place edits, a cut and
appended bytes, with SHA-256s pinning the stock and the result. It carries no original bytes: the stock hash pins them.
Source of truth: the firmware project's `docs/reference/patch-format.md` and `tools/make_patch.py`, and its synthetic
conformance vector, which Studio's tests apply (`__fixtures__/conformanceVector.json`) so both reach the same bytes.
Studio's port is `src/core/firmware/patch/formats/baofeng-uv5rmini-firmware/`.

**Apply** (pure: the input is never changed, and nothing comes out unless every check passes):

1. Check the stock file's size and SHA-256 against `stock`.
2. Copy it.
3. Write each edit in place.
4. Cut to `truncate`.
5. Append `append`.
6. Check the result's size and SHA-256 against `result`.

With the same loader the usual patch cuts at the stock size and appends nothing. When the loader changes, the patch cuts
earlier and appends the replacement.

**Caps:** the result is at most 1 MiB (1,048,576 bytes) and a patch has at most 4096 edits. Hex is lowercase; so are
all hashes.

**Refusals** (`patch-malformed` unless noted):

- `name` or `format` wrong (an unknown name or format number is `patch-unknown-format`).
- `stock` or `result` not exactly the one key `.ufw`; a missing or mistyped field.
- Bad hex (odd length, non-hex characters, uppercase); an uppercase hash.
- An empty edit; an edit outside `[0, truncate)`; edits out of order or overlapping.
- `truncate` longer than the stock size; a result over 1 MiB; more than 4096 edits.
- `build.name` not 1 to 21 printable ASCII characters with no space; `appSize` or `appCrc` not a `0x` hex number;
  `loader.sha256` not 64 lowercase hex characters; `loader.list` not a list of such names.
- The stock file's size or hash differs, or the package holds anything but the one `ufw` file: `patch-wrong-stock`.
- The result's size or hash differs from the recorded one: `patch-result-mismatch`.

`build`, `loader` and `base` are checked for shape only. They are exposed on the parsed patch for the image checks that
come later, and are never used to relax any check above.

`readVersionStamp` returns `build.name`: the image's version slot is scrambled per radio, so Studio cannot read it back
from the result.

## What Studio checks

- **Patch format (this page):** everything in the refusal list above, in the parser and in `apply`.
- **Image checks:** the checks on the built image itself are not part of the format and get their own section when they
  land.
