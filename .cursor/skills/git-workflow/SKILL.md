# codeplug-studio Git Workflow

## Overview

This repo is a **Vite + React + TypeScript SPA** (when scaffolded) with `src/core/`, `src/integrations/`, and `src/app/`, deployed to **GitHub Pages** when a **full GitHub release is published** (not a pre-release). One issue, one branch, one PR.

Workflow: plan → issue (when non-trivial) → branch → commit → PR → merge to `main` → publish a GitHub release to publish Pages.

Use the **`user-github`** MCP for issues and PRs. The `gh` CLI is not available on this machine.

For larger initiatives, pair with [progress-tracking](../progress-tracking/SKILL.md) and [feature-docs](../feature-docs/SKILL.md).

**Product context:** [DESIGN.md](../../../DESIGN.md), [docs/poc-migration/epic-1-context.md](../../../docs/poc-migration/epic-1-context.md).

---

## 1. Planning and Issues

**Small fix or single-file tweak:** branch and PR without an issue is fine.

**Features and multi-commit work:** create one GitHub issue in `pskillen/codeplug-studio` with:

- Problem and intended outcome
- Which layer is affected (`src/core/`, `src/app/`, `docs/`, …)
- Link to a Cursor plan if one exists
- For non-trivial scope: links to progress files under `docs/poc-migration/` or `docs/features/`

Start from a lightweight user request? Update the same issue with the agreed plan — do not create a duplicate.

---

## 2. Branch Naming

| Situation | Format | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Issue tracked | `{num}/{author}/{short-description}` | `12/pskil/zone-grouping-ui` |
| No issue | `{type}/{short-description}` | `feat/library-crud`, `chore/repo-setup` |

Use kebab-case. Keep descriptions short.

Create branches from **`origin/main`** unless the work explicitly depends on another open branch.

---

## 3. Pre-commit Checks

When `package.json` exists, run the checks relevant to your change:

- `npm run lint` and `npm run format:check` — ESLint + Prettier
- `npm run test` — Vitest
- `npm run build` — type-check and Vite production build when touching build/config
- `npm run dev` and exercise the affected route if behaviour changed
- Confirm no secrets (Mapbox tokens, OAuth, personal CPS files) are staged
- Match existing patterns in the target module

**Phase 0 / docs-only:** no `npm run` required — manual review of markdown and cursor rules.

**Formatting:** `npm run format` writes fixes; `npm run format:check` is what CI runs. If `format:check` fails locally, run `npm run format`, review the diff, and commit the result.

---

## 4. Commits

Use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `chore`

**Scope:** feature slug when helpful — e.g. `library`, `builds`, `repo`

**Rules:**

- Atomic commits per logical change
- Brief but descriptive
- Do **not** use the word "enhance"

**Examples:**

```
feat(library): add channel CRUD mutations
docs(design): clarify trait profile wording
chore(rules): add layer-boundaries cursor rule
```

---

## 5. Running git in Cursor agents

When the **Shell** tool runs `git`:

1. **Always set `working_directory`** to the repo root: `C:\Users\pskil\git\codeplug-studio`. Commands that only `cd` inside the command string often return empty output even on success.

2. **Good pattern**

   ```text
   working_directory: C:\Users\pskil\git\codeplug-studio
   command:            git fetch origin && git status -sb
   ```

3. **Permissions:** `required_permissions: ["git_write"]` for checkout/commit; add `"network"` for `fetch` / `push`.

4. **PRs and issues:** use `user-github` MCP — not `gh`.

5. **Commits:**

   **Plan execution** (active `.cursor/plans/` file, user said "execute/continue the plan",
   or multi-slice work with commit checkpoints):
   - Commit at every **commit checkpoint** before starting the next slice.
   - Run `git status -sb` — working tree must be clean before the next slice.
   - Commit little and often; committing is not cheap to skip but cheap to do.
   - Docs are slices too — own checkpoint, own commit; not deferred to PR time.
   - **Forbidden:** batching many file edits then multiple `git commit` commands in one shell block.
   - After any conversation summary: `git log -5` and `git status -sb` — do not assume prior commits.

   **Ad-hoc conversation** (single question, review, unplanned tweak):
   - Do not commit unless the user asks.

## 6. Pull Requests

When work is ready:

1. When toolchain exists: run `npm run format` and commit any Prettier fixes.
2. When toolchain exists: run `npm run format:check && npm run lint && npm run test && npm run build`.
3. Push the branch.
4. Open one PR in `pskillen/codeplug-studio` via `user-github` MCP
5. Link the issue (`Closes #N`) when applicable
6. Note which layer changed and how to smoke-test locally

**PR description template:**

```markdown
## Summary
- …

## Test plan
- [ ] `npm run format:check && npm run lint && npm run test && npm run build` (when applicable)
- [ ] `npm run dev`, exercise affected routes
- [ ] …
```

## Quick Reference

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| Plan | Issue for non-trivial work; link plan + feature docs |
| Branch | `{num}/{author}/{slug}` or `{type}/{slug}` from `origin/main` |
| Pre-commit | lint, test, build when `package.json` exists; no secrets in diff |
| Commit | Conventional commits; atomic; Shell `working_directory` = repo root |
| PR | push; one PR; link issue; describe manual test steps |
| Deploy | Merge to `main`, then publish a full GitHub release (tag `v*`) → GitHub Pages (`base: '/codeplug-studio/'`) |
